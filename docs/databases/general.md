#Databases

## Types of Databases
There are many types of databases but the two main types are OLTP (online transaction processing) and OLAP (online analytical processing). OLTP is mostly used to store data in rows where we need to query data to get single rows. These are usefull as they usally map to software classes directly so the database table would match the software object. While OLAP is used to query columns any usally do some type of aggrigations on that data to come up with some analytics.
